# Verilog Simulation of Synthesiser Components


## Setup

The package **iverilog** is required for running the simulation.

Optionally **gtkwave** can be used for viewing the waveforms.

## Running the Simulation

In order to run the simulation, run the following command

```
make run
```

This will generate the STDIO output of the watch variables as well as generate the output file (**TestBench.vcd**)

**gtkwave** can be used to view the waveform by opening that file. 

Note, I also have a project file saved called **WaveView.gtkw** that can be openend which has the waveforms already imported and formated nicer.
